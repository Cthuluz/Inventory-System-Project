Java Inventory System Project

This project creates a user interface for inventory management of parts and products of vehicles. Products are made of multiple parts, and the list of products and parts are contained in their own observable list. 

Main page to view products and parts:

![Inventory Management System main page](https://github.com/Cthuluz/Inventory-System-Project/assets/23242570/5e399ad9-014c-42f7-8a59-483ea0bbb063)

Parts and products can be searched within the upper search bars, and each part and product is identified with a unique ID.

Page to add parts:

![Inventory Management System - Add page](https://github.com/Cthuluz/Inventory-System-Project/assets/23242570/2e4ea61e-5aaf-403c-a15f-ce28e7630497)

All fields can be filled out except for the part ID, which is assigned automatically when the part is added. The In-House and Outsourced radio buttons can be toggled to determine part type, which changes the MachineID label to a "Company Name" label.

Page to modify parts:

![Inventory Management System - Modify page](https://github.com/Cthuluz/Inventory-System-Project/assets/23242570/11d4d975-e6bf-4859-976c-76f4a77dde03)
